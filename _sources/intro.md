# Welcome to Phys 3200 - Classical Mechanics 

This is an interactive Jupyter Book for Phys 3200- Classical Mechanics I at CSUSB for Fall 2025.

## Learning Outcomes


Goal 1 – Students should have in-depth knowledge of the foundational subjects in physics (primarily classical mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics & statistical mechanics, special relativity, and quantum mechanics) and be able to apply that knowledge to problem-solving.

Outcome 1.1: Students will continue to develop an understanding of the principles of classical mechanics at the undergraduate level by formulating and solving quantitative problems. This will be exhibited in the following ways.
1.1a: Homework problems covering a range of topics.
1.1b: Problem-solving on end of topic quizzes.

Goal 2 – Students should have the ability to use introductory coding techniques to build physical models and solve problems. Ability to work with spreadsheets to analyze data.

Outcome 2.1: Students will develop basic computational and coding techniques important to physical models in classical mechanics. This will be exhibited in the following ways.
2.1a: Developing solutions to mini-computational problems.
1.1b: Final computational project.
