- Due on Friday, August 29th by 11:59 pm on Gradescope
- Include your full name and Coyote ID on the top of the first page
- Clearly circle or box your final answer for each question or part of a question
- Solutions should be neatly written and easy to follow â€¢ You must individually tag each question on Gradescope to the appropriate pages or images that you upload. If you do not tag your work for a given problem you will not receive credit for it.
## Problems
This is a practice homework to make sure you are tagging problems correctly on Gradescope. We are going to be strict this semester about not giving credit to problems that do not have work correctly tagged for it, as it is quite time consuming to search for work and solutions manually for large classes. The two problems below will get full credit as long as 1) You put something as an answer and 2) You correctly tagged it on Gradescope.

1. What is your favorite book you have read for fun and why?
2. Draw a picture of your favorite animal?
