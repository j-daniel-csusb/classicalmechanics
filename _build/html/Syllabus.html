<p><strong>Course Information<br />
Course Title:</strong> Classical Mechanics, PHYS 3200<br />
<strong>Class Time:</strong> TR 3:00 pm - 4:45 pm<br />
<strong>Classroom:</strong> Physical Science Building 209<br />
<strong>Prerequisites/Math Preparation:</strong> PHYS 2510 and PHYS 2520L <strong>Corequisite</strong>: PHYS 3100</p>
<p><strong>Department of Physics Mission Statement:</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to teach students how to measure, describe, and explain natural phenomena through scientific investigation and critical thinking. Students learn the concepts of physics, quantitative methods for analysis, experimental techniques for testing theoretical predictions, and the skills necessary to discover new phenomena. The study of a range of fundamental topics and the underlying theory reveals physics to be a stimulating and rewarding discipline that has important connections to other sciences, modern technology, and society as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Program-level Student Learning Goals and Outcomes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 –</strong> Students should have in-depth knowledge of the foundational subjects in physics (primarily classical mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics &amp; statistical mechanics, special relativity, and quantum mechanics) and be able to apply that knowledge to problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome 1.1:</strong> Students will continue to develop an understanding of the principles of classical mechanics at the undergraduate level by formulating and solving quantitative problems. This will be exhibited in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>1.1a:</strong> Homework problems covering a range of topics.</p>
<p><strong>1.1b:</strong> Problem-solving on end of topic quizzes.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2</strong> – Students should have the ability to use introductory coding techniques to build physical models and solve problems. Ability to work with spreadsheets to analyze data.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome 2.1:</strong> Students will develop basic computational and coding techniques important to physical models in classical mechanics. This will be exhibited in the following ways.</p>
<p><strong>2.1a:</strong> Developing solutions to mini-computational problems.</p>
<p><strong>1.1b:</strong> Final computational project.</p>
<p><strong>Course website:</strong> Canvas and GitHub Jupyter Book</p>
<p>I will make announcements, post assignments, links, and grades, and make an electronic version of this syllabus available on Canvas. You should check the Canvas daily - you are responsible for knowing all the information we have posted there.</p>
<p>There will be a secondary website hosting an interactive Jupyter Book containing lecture notes, examples, important links and information. The website will remain accessible for everyone regardless of enrollment.</p>
<p><strong>Required Materials:</strong></p>
<p><em>Classical Mechanics, by John R. Taylor.</em></p>
<p>Our goal is to cover most topics in chapters 1-13 in Taylor, the first ~5-6 chapters of the book will be mostly review of topics covered in General Physics I (Phys 2500). It is best if you read ahead in the book, then our coverage in class will reinforce your reading.**</p>
<p><em>Elementary Mechanics using Python, by Anders Malthe-Sørenssen</em></p>
<p>We will use this book as a computational resource and cover most of the material within it. While this book is required you will not be forced to read it but use it as reference as we work through our computational endeavors. Most of the computational examples will come from this text.</p>
<p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p>
<p>PHYS 3200 is the upper-division study of classical mechanics, the study of motion. You began learning classical mechanics in PHYS 2500 (we will now revisit some of this material at a higher level and with more mathematics). You will also learn some new techniques that will make certain types of otherwise difficult problems much easier (just as in PHYS 2500, you learned that using conservation of energy made certain problems easier than using forces).</p>
<p>This course is a problem-solving-heavy course involving a detailed mathematical framework. You should try to solve as many problems as possible. Make sure to work through the homework and examples in the lecture.</p>
<p>We will be utilizing basic coding skills in python, but no previous experience is required. Most of the ‘coding’ will be given to you as a scaffolded shell in which you will input the physics required for the computation to work. You will be expected to comment on what the code is doing, what individual pieces mean, and why specific sections are important.</p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: Homework will be assigned and posted on Canvas for each chapter. You are strongly encouraged to work through the homework along with the lectures. Due dates will be posted on Canvas. There will be a penalty for late submission. Homework solutions will be posted regularly on Canvas as well. You are encouraged to work together on homework. The homework itself will vary week to week and consist of problems from the book(s) as well as mini-computational projects.</p>
<p><strong>End of Topic Quizzes (~11-12)</strong>: There will be a short quiz (~20-30 mins) following the end of most chapters which will test your knowledge gained relating to material covered in the specific individual chapter. End of Topic Quiz dates will be set as we progress through the material and inherently will fluctuate dates relative to the pace of the class. Each quiz must be taken on a specific date so attendance will be very important.</p>
<p><strong>Final Computational Project</strong>: This course will not have a final cumulative exam but will have a final cumulative computational project in which students will identify a classical problem, analyze it through computational methods, and present their findings.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></p>
<p>While we will not have a portion of the overall grade reflect class attendance it is important to attend all scheduled class meetings. A few missed lectures due to unforeseen circumstances will not be a problem, however you will not be successful in this course without attending lectures. All quizzes will be assigned during class time and will occur at varying times throughout the semester, missing one class could put you at risk of missing quizzes or important instruction. If there are circumstances that prevent you from attending a class meeting let the instructor know in as far in advance as possible so that arrangements can be made, if there is no attempt to adequately inform the instructor no make-up work will be available for any missed material due to absence.</p>

<p><strong>Grading Policy</strong></p>
<p>Your grade for this course is based on the following activities, weighted as shown.</p>
<p><strong>Grade Distribution Percentage</strong></p>
<p>Lecture notes		 5%</p>
<p>Keeping detailed and useful lecture notes is a requirement for succeeding in learning any topic and to depict this importance a portion (5%) of your entire grade will be based on taking notes during lecture. We will have 5 notebook check-ins throughout the semester in which I will evaluate your note keeping, each check-in will contribute 1% towards the cumulative total. Your notes can be in any legible form be it a physical or E-notebook.</p>
<p>In class Participation		10%</p>
<p>This course will require in class participation in the form of asking questions, completing worksheets, sharing with peers, and open form problem solving. All of these will be graded based on participation, not correctness.</p>
<p>Homework		15%</p>
<p>We will have weekly homework assignments or projects in which students will work on assigned problems from the book and some weeks we will have ‘mini-computational’ projects that students will be tasked with. Homework will be graded both on completion and randomly on correctness for a chosen number of problems from any assigned problem set. All homework will have posted solutions shortly after the due dates. All homework assignments will have an optional reflection to make up for a portion of any lost points on the assignment, these reflections will be due one week after the solutions for the original assignment are posted.</p>
<p><br />
End of Topic Quizzes   40%</p>
<p>We will have a short quiz (~20-30 mins) at the end of each chapter we cover during this course. We plan to cover around 8 chapters so that means there will be roughly 8 quizzes, where each quiz will account for roughly ~5% of your total grade. The cumulative score of all quizzes will be based on only 6 out of the 8 total quizzes, this means that roughly 2 quizzes will be dropped depending on the number of chapters we cover throughout the course. If the quiz was previously attempted, students will also have a chance to complete an optional reflection for any quiz they choose that will be worth 50% of any missing points for a given quiz. The optional reflection will be due one week after grades and/or solutions are posted for the designated quiz.</p>
<p>Final Project                30%</p>
<p>Each student will demonstrate what they learned throughout the course by identifying a classical mechanics-based problem and attempting to solve and/or analyze it. This will be done in the form of a formal project. Which will consist of: A literature review covering the aspects and key ideas of the problem, a computational/analytical analysis of the problem, identification of a solution or application of the problem and a class presentation tying it all together and relaying it to an audience.</p>
<p>The deliverables of the project will be:</p>
<p>A short paper (~2 pages) describing the project as a whole. (10%)</p>
<p>A commented and organized jupyter notebook for all the code required for the project (10%)</p>
<p>A short (~8 min) in class presentation (10%)</p>
<p>Extra Credit:</p>
<p>Office Hours               up to 5%</p>
<p>Attending office hours and asking questions is a proven way to better your understanding of any course you are taking, and we will be reflecting on this importance through the opportunity of extra credit by attending <em><strong>at least 5</strong></em> office hour sessions throughout the semester. Not only will attending these sessions help you with your understanding of course material it will create a comfortable and fun classroom environment.</p>

<p><strong>The Policy and Procedures Concerning Academic Dishonesty states</strong>:</p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are violations of the Student Discipline Code (see Appendix of the CSUSB Catalogue of Programs) and may be dealt with by both the instructor and the Judicial Affairs Officer. Plagiarism is the act of presenting the ideas and writings of another as one’s own. Cheating is the act of obtaining or attempting to obtain credit for academic work through the use of any dishonest, deceptive, or fraudulent means. Plagiarism is academically dishonest and makes the offending student liable to penalties up to and including expulsion.</p>
<p>Students must make appropriate acknowledgments of the original source where material is written or complied by another is used.</p>
<p>Questions about academic dishonesty and the policy should be addressed to the Office of the Vice President, Student Affairs.</p>
<p>ChatGPT and Generative AI Tools Policy</p>
<p>The best way to learn is through practice! This course’s activities and the grading scheme have been created to reward learning through practice, even if you do not get it right the first time! As such, this course assumes that work submitted by students – all process work, drafts, brainstorming artifacts, final works – will be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups as directed by class assignment instructions. This policy indicates the following constitute violations of academic honesty: a student has another person/entity do the work of any substantive portion of a graded assignment for them, which includes purchasing work from a company, hiring a person or company to complete an assignment or exam, and/or using generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) to generate work and claiming it as one’s own. There will be uses for generative AI tools in this course, however their use must be referenced, and the prompts used to generate any used work must be retained for reference. It must be made clear to the instructor that any additional generative tools were used and in what specific capacity, such as implicit permission, must be obtained by asking the instructor for guidance whenever generative AI tools are implemented.</p>
